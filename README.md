## Why this project?
- <p>For the last couple of months, I'm using OBSIDIAN.md, a fantastic note-taking app, for tracking my studies and boosting productivity and I LOVE IT. But, after using for a while, yesterday, when I was about to present couple of notes to my friend, I had faced some serious challenges, publishing my notes.</p>
					<p>Browsing into the forum, I've come to know about Obsidian-Publish and some other alternatives. While <b>Obsidian publish </b>costs <b><strike>12</strike> 8$ per month and works flawlessly </b> (which is btw a lot for the students like me with zero incomeðŸ˜¢), I have faced a hard time understanding its free alternatives. Also, all free alternatives lack the most interesting feature of OBSIDIAN, a.k.a the <b>Graph View</b>. </p>
					<p>That's why after 20+ hours of code and 6 cups of coffee, here's my version of the free Obsidian Publish with <i>Graph View </i>ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³....</p>

					<ul>

						<li>Click â˜° on top left to open the MENU.</li>
						<li>Click ðŸ•¸ on top right to open the Graph.</li>
						<li>On 'Menu', toggle the switch to enable/ disable dark mode.</li>
						<!--img src="pages/guide.PNG" id="guide"-->
					</ul>
					<p> This page is <b>fully responsive.</b></p>


					<p>Happy browsing ðŸ™Œ... </p>

					<p> Oh, one last thing. So far, this website is partially-generated from obsidian (around 60%). I'm currently working for full automation. Hope, I'll be able to achieve my goal sometime soon.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, if you love my effort, you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/yoursamlan" target="_blank">buy me a coffee.</a> That will be AWESOME ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š. Also, any feedback/ suggestion is highly appreciated.ðŸ˜Š </p>
