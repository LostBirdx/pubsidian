## Features
- Completely FREE
- Fully Responsive Notes.
- Graph View for Understanding Correlation BETTER and EASIER.
- Load where you left off.
- Search your note from a larger database.

## Dependency
- Only [d3.js](https://d3js.org) for generating the Graph. Apart from that, written completely in vanilla JS. No other JS library is used.

## Why this project?
- For the last couple of months, I'm using OBSIDIAN.md, a fantastic note-taking app, for tracking my studies and boosting productivity and **I LOVE IT**. But, after using for a while, yesterday, when I was about to present couple of notes to my friend, I had faced some serious challenges, publishing my notes.
- Browsing into the forum, I've come to know about Obsidian-Publish and some other alternatives. While [Obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) costs **8$ per month and works flawlessly** (which is btw a lot for the students like me with zero incomeðŸ˜¢), I have faced a hard time understanding its free alternatives. Also, all free alternatives lack the most interesting feature of OBSIDIAN, a.k.a the **Graph View**.
- That's why after 20+ hours of code and 6 cups of coffee, here's [my version](https://yoursamlan.github.io/pubsidian) of the free Obsidian Publish with **Graph View**ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³...

## What's new in version 2.0:
- From now on, internal navigation will be auto-generated from ```data.json``` 

## Things to DO...
- [ ] Making the process fully automatic. So that, you can convert your whole vault with just one click.
- [ ] Adding page navigation to the Graph View, so that you can move quickly from one age to another just by using GraphView.
- [ ] Theme supports and other customization.

If you have any idea/ suggestion, please put it in the issues.

Thank you :)
